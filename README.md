# MoveOUGSuite Script

If you have the need to move batch users to another OrganizationUnit on GSuite you can use this script.

You can save the users's email on a CSV, and import on the Google Sheets, and then get the sheet ID and put it on the readRange parameter next thing you have to do is to set the desired OU on the orgunittomove variable.
